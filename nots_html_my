• <img>       : To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is a self closing element. It needs to carry the following
                attribute:
    - src : This tells the browser where it can find the image file

==============================================================
•HTML FORMS
  - Forms are basically a container for all of these different types of inputs.
  - Forms are created using <form></form> tag.
  - Checkboxes, buttons, dropdown menus, and color pickers go in form tag.
  - Forms are sending data to server or database or wherever we set it up to sent.
  - The form we create could be just creating a get request.
  - Example: Google search, or logins
  - Or it could be creating a post request;
  - Example: Signing up to a website
--------------------------------------------
• <input>:   The <input> element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the
             type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating
• type=“text”:  When the type attribute has a value of text, it creates a single line text input.
  name       :  When users enter information into a form, the server needs to know which form control each piece of data was entered into
• type=“password”:  When the type attribute has a value of password it creates a text box that acts
                   just like a single-line text input, except the characters are blocked out.
   name  : The name attribute indicates the name of the password input, which is sent to the server with the password the user enters
•The <textarea> : element is used to create a multi-line text input. Unlike other input elements this is not an empty element.
                It should therefore have an opening an closing tag.
-------------------------------------------------------------
•type=“radio” : Radio buttons allow users to pick just one of a number of options
•type=“checkbox”: Checkboxes allow users to select(and unselect) one or more options in answer to a question.
 name: The name attribute is sent to the server with the value of the option(s) the user selects.
 value: The value attribute indicates the value sent to the server if this checkbox is checked.
 checked: The checked attribute indicates that this box should be checked when the page loads. If used, its value should be checked
 --------------------------------------------------------------
•What are the differences between radio button and checkboxes?
   • Each checkbox operates individually.
   • Options are independent from each other.
   • So users are allowed to select multiple options at once.
   • Radio buttons, however, operate as a group and are used to allow user to select one from a set of options.
   • So users are allowed to select only one option.
 -----------------------------------------------------------
•DROP DOWN LIST BOX
 <select>:  A drop down list box(also known as a select box) allows users to select one option from a drop
            down list. The <select> element is used to create a drop down list box.
 name: The name attribute indicates the name of the form control being sent to the server, along
       with the value the user selected.
 <option> : The <option> element is used to specify the options that the user can select from.
 value    : The <option> element uses the value attribute to indicate the value that is sent to the server
            along with the name of the control if this option is selected.
 selected:  The selected attribute can be used to indicate the option that should be selected when the page loads
