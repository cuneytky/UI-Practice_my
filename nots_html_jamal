    #2- <html> </html> tag :
        - is the parent/ascendent of all other web elements

    #3- <head> </head> tag :

    - h1 thru h6 will create different size of headers
    - h1 biggest, h6 smallest


-> What is an ATTRIBUTE?
    - Attributes provide additional information about given tag.
    - We can have as many attributes as we want to have.
    - Attributes will always go inside of the opening tag (if it is a paired tag)
    - If it is unpaired tag (self-closing tag), it will go inside of the tag itself.

    syntax:

    <openingTag attributeName1="attributeValue" attributeName2="attributeValue"> CONTENT </closingTag>

    </selfClosingTag attributeName1="attributeValue">
